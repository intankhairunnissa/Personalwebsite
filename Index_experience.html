	<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
	<p><b style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: darksalmon;">2018-2019</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Working in Printing Service. After finish spm leaver, before going into university life, I have worked in printing service near my house. There are experience when i do part time job. Firstly, I can earn extra pocket money. Being a student usually means little or no money, but when i am working part time, I no longer have to worry about being able to afford the basic essentials – or relying on my parents or student funding to get by. Other than that, I learn to manage my money which is When I start making money of my own, I tend to become more cautious about how I spend my hard-earned cash. Next, I also become more confident. If you’re shy and introverted, a part-time job can help you come out of your shell and aid in growing your confidence. I also can develop my interpersonal skills. As well as confidence, student employment provides you with an opportunity to learn how to interact with different personalities – an essential skill in all types of jobs.Through part-time work, I will learn how to talk to a variety of people from different walks of life, forcing me to be sensitive to cultural differences in the workplace. I will also learn the best ways to communicate with my colleagues, forcing me to think about how my words can affect other people’s actions and vice versa </p>
