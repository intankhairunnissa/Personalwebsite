			<td>This is a picture of My Father. His name is Kamalaudin bin Kassim. He is 54 years old. Me and my father are very close to each other.Whenever I fall ill, he takes care of me 24 by 7. When he fall ill, I cant see him in that dull state I either cry or be sad (I am quite emotional). He is very cool. He has a great sense of humour. He is the most hardworking person I have seen. He takes life practically and teach me also. Many of our relatives and friends appreciate the bond between us. Many of them say I look like my father but I am not sure if I really look like him. He will never allow something bad happening to our family, He can go any extent to protect his family. He is my inspiration, I look up to be like him. He is a great father, awesome husband, superb son and the best brother!</td>

		<td>This is a picture of My Mother. Her name is Sarina Binti Husman. She is 51 years old. My mother is the most important person in my life and the most powerful individual I know. She is very beautiful and has the kindest eyes that I have ever seen. She not only worked hard to ensure that I had a good upbringing, but was also very strict and often punished me whenever I went wrong. Even though I did not like the punishment then, I now look back and realize that it was meant to lovingly correct me and help me to follow the right path when growing up.

Most siblings are always quarreling, and never do anything together.  <br>My brother and I are most definitely not like that, we do everything together.  Throughout my life I have modeled to be more like him, he is not only my older brother but my peer and my role model.

	    <td> This is a picture of My Family. Which they are my backbone, my supporter and everything. There are four people in my family — me, my mum and dad, and my older brother. Me and my family Kuala Terengganu. So, my dad — he’s a government official. And my mum is a amazing housewife. My older brother, still study in degree. My mum always insists that the family sits together and has Sunday lunch together. It is very important to her. We have a big lunch and it is a good time to talk together and share things about our lives. We always go on holiday every year together. My dad loves to plan this big holiday — he makes me and my brother join him at the dinner table and we go over travel destinations. Me, my brother and my dad like to go fishing together. To be honest, my dad really enjoys fishing — me and my brother just like to go and look around by the river and the boats.
